# Automate Frontend Test Performance Using Grunt
### Perf Budget
* Allows you to fail if you don't meet your budget targets (render time, speedindex, etc.)

### WebPageTest
* We can setup our own webpagetest server.
* A grunt task has been written that saves JSON data - could build dashboards out of this!

### CSS Stats
* Allows us to measure the number of colours, fonts, font sizes etc.
