# Design + Performance
* Designers & Developers often work in silos
* Some designs make it hard to make websites fast

### How to Resolve
* Small interdisciplinary teams
* Guiding Principals
    - What's important to the business?
    - What are we trying to achieve?
* Prototype early
    - Work with code
    - Real data sources
    - Change the DOM live with designers, developers and product
* Measure performance from the start
* Performance Budgets
    - Can have in page reminder widgets that surfaces when the performance is unacceptable.

### Page load time is not the best metric
* Start render and Speed Index are better!

### Custom Metrics
* Define the most important elements on the page
* Measure using User Timing
* Track with RUM and synthetic
